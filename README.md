# AI Sommelier: Wine Quality Prediction

## Problem Description

Wine quality assessment traditionally relies on human experts, whose evaluations can be subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. With the growth of wine production and distribution, there is a need for a reliable, scalable, and data-driven way to estimate wine quality before it reaches consumers or goes into further processing.

This project uses the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset) to build a machine learning model that predicts the quality score of wine based on its physicochemical properties (such as acidity, sugar level, pH, sulfur dioxide, alcohol content, etc.). By analyzing these features, the model aims to estimate wine quality in a consistent and objective way.

The solution can be used by:

- wine producers — to monitor and improve production quality

- quality control teams — to automate quality screening

- researchers and students — to explore real-world regression/classification problems

- data scientists — to experiment with feature engineering and model performance optimization

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how machine learning can support decision-making in the food and beverage industry by transforming laboratory measurements into actionable quality predictions.
